Smart contracts, as integral components of blockchain technology, play a pivotal role in automating and executing agreements in a trust free manner. However, ensuring the correctness and reliability of smart contracts remains a significant challenge due to their complex nature and potential vulnerabilities. To address this challenge, we propose SmartML, a novel modeling language tailored specifically to smart contracts. This paper presents an in-depth exploration of the features, advantages, and applications of the proposed modeling language. By providing a precise and intuitive means of describing smart contract behaviors, SmartML aims to support the development, verification, and validation of smart contracts, ultimately bolstering trust and confidence in them. Furthermore, we discuss the relation to our modeling language with existing blockchain technologies and highlight its potential to streamline integration efforts. We posit SmartML as a versatile tool to advance, interoperability, reliability, and security of smart contracts in blockchain ecosystems.
