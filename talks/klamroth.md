Machine Learning and Quantum Computing must be recognized as the new technological frontiers, reshaping the landscape of computation across diverse fields. Their unreliable and highly complex nature, however, poses significant challenges regarding their use in practice as it requires rigorous verification to obtain formal guarantees of correctness. In classical software systems, verification was made possible by a series of principles (program decomposition, determinism, etc.) that no longer apply in quantum and ML software. In this paper, we examine similarities between the formal verification of quantum and ML software and identify common research directions. Particularly in the field of ML, there are ongoing research efforts, which we expect to generate synergies that can be exploited in the context of quantum software. We discuss significant overlaps and research opportunities and propose a close collaboration of those two fields in the future.
