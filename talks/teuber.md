The novel framework of Heterogeneous Dynamic Logic presented in this talk allows the systematic combination of multiple program reasoning theories in dynamic logic, similar to the framework of satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) that allows the systematic combination of multiple theories in first-order logic.
Just like the foundation behind SMT are the conditions under which first-order theory combinations preserve decidability, the foundation here are the conditions under which program theory combinations preserve relative completeness.
The resulting combination principles are useful because they make it possible to modularly combine program reasoning on different levels and with different foci:
While preserving a clear separation of concerns between theories, we nonetheless enable a strong combination of insights across theories.
