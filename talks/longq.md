We prove the completeness of an axiomatization for initial value problems (IVPs) with compact initial conditions and compact time horizons for bounded open safety, open liveness and existence properties. This result is achieved via a computable procedure that generates symbolic proofs with differential invariants for rigorous error bounds of numerical solutions to such IVPs, bringing insights from symbolic logic and numerical analysis. As the axiomatization is a subset of the implemented axioms in Keymaera X, this also provides a theoretical justification for the verification power of Keymaera X.
