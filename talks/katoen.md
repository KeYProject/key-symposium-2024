Probabilistic programs encode randomised algorithms, robot controllers, learning components, security mechanisms, and much more. They are however hard to grasp. Not only by humans, also by computers: checking elementary properties related to e.g., termination are "more undecidable" than for ordinary programs. Although this all sounds like a no-go for automated analysis, I will present some non-trivial analyses of probabilistic programs using push-button technology. Our techniques are all based on weakest precondition reasoning. We will address automated techniques for run-time analysis, k-induction, and the synthesis of probabilistic loop invariants.
