Finite-precision programs inevitably introduce numerical uncertainties due to input noises and finite-precision (roundoff) errors inherent in arithmetic operations. Furthermore, implementing these programs on hardware necessitates a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that numerical uncertainties remain acceptably small and to optimize implementations for accurate results tailored to specific applications.

Existing analysis and optimization techniques for finite-precision often face challenges related to scalability and applicability in real-world scenarios. In this talk, I will provide a brief overview of my PhD research, which aimed to develop methods for handling input uncertainties and improving the scalability of the state-of-the-art, thus broadening their scope for practical applications.
