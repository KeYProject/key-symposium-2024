For those who want to get some panoramic views of the area and, if weather permits, through the Rhine valley up to the Vosges, we organize a voluntary hike on Monday afternoon just before the symposium officially starts.
The hike is of medium difficulty and leads us about 9 km distance and 260 m elevation through the Northern Black Forest on a former border trail between Baden and WÃ¼rttemberg marked by ancient rock formations that go back to the Triassic.
In order to get to and from the start and end point of the hike, we will optionally take a short bus ride. There is also the option of a detour of roughly 2 km to pass by the gorgeous Falkensteinfelsen with views on Bad Herrenalb.
