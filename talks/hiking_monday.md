For those who want to get some panoramic views of the area and, if weather permits, through the Rhine valley up to the Vosges, we organize a voluntary hike on Monday afternoon just before the symposium officially starts. The hike is of medium difficulty and leads us about 9 km distance and 260 m elevation through the Northern Black Forest on a former border trail between Baden and Württemberg marked by ancient rock formations that go back to the Triassic. In order to get to and from the start and end point of the hike, we will optionally take a short bus ride. There is also the option of a detour of roughly 2 km to pass by the gorgeous Falkensteinfelsen with views on Bad Herrenalb.

1. *Meeting time, 12:35 p.m. at the venue*

   We will meet a little earlier due to a sparse bus schedule. Please either join 12:35 p.m. at the venue or be 12:45 p.m. at the bus stop “Bad Herrenalb Post” (we will take bus #113 which leaves at 12:59 p.m.) next to the park in front of the train/tram station. If you only have light luggage and are arriving just in time by tram, you can also directly hop on the bus at the station “Kullenmühle, Bad Herrenalb”, which is one stop before the train station.

2. *Bus ticket / cash payment*

	If you do not have tickets for the local buses (e.g., the “Deutschlandticket”) already, it is best to get a KVV day ticket for one “Wabe” (literally “honeycomb”, the smallest distance unit in the local public transport system), which costs €4.80. Tickets for groups are cheaper, and you can save up to €1.92. Be also aware that the bus driver might only take cash and no card payments.
	
3. *Food and drink*

	It is advisable to bring some food and water for the hike. There will be nice picnic spots on the way. Moreover, I have been informed that lunch is not available at the venue before the hike, so please try not to arrive in low energy.
	
4. *What to wear*
   Generally, the hike's difficulty is easy to medium. However, especially the paths to the panorama platforms can be slippery and wearing stable shoes such as hiking boots is advisable. Moreover, most of the hike will be in the woods, but it is probably still advisable to bring your sunglasses, some sunscreen, and maybe a funny hat.

According to my current list, we will be 21 people on the hike. In case you know of anybody who wants to join, but who forgot to tick the according box in the registration form, please pass this information on and give me a quick notification.

In case of any questions or concerns or things we should know, please do not hesitate to email [Michael Kirsten](kirsten@kit.edu).
