This talk introduces sabotage as an additional, simple and natural primitive game action in Parikh’s game logic, which allows players to lay traps for the opponent. This closes the expressiveness gap between game logic and the strictly more expressive modal mu-calculus. This reveals a close connection between the entangled nested recursion inherent in modal fixpoint logics and adversarial dynamic rule changes characteristic for sabotage games. Completeness is transferred from the proof calculus for the mu-calculus via syntactic equiexpressiveness transformations. The completeness of a simple extension of Parikh’s calculus for game logic follows. Applied to differential game logic, these results show that the differential mu-calculus is complete with respect to first-order fixpoint logic and differential game logic is complete with respect to its ODE-free fragment via a fixpoint characterisation of the continuous dynamics.
