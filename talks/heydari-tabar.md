We developed a program logic and a sequent calculus to formally address the data dependence analysis problem in high-performance computing. This program logic is rich and powerful enough to be used in different contexts when the problem at hand can be formulated in terms of data dependences. In this presentation, we briefly discuss such problems (e.g., method contract generation, noninterference verification, branch prediction, etc.).
