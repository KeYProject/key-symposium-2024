Resolution and superposition are prime examples of proof systems implemented in saturation-based theorem provers. These have a rich metatheory, which both is interesting in its own right and partly explains why the provers perform well in practice. My collegues and I formalized the soundness and completeness proofs of resolution and superposition in Isabelle/HOL. In addition, we developed a so-called saturation framework, on paper and in Isabelle, that makes such proofs easier to carry out and more modular.
