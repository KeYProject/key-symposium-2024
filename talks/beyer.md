Stipula is an executable language that formalizes the operational semantics of legal contracts. It combines aspects from state automata, time, asynchronous and imperative programming. We sketch how a large class of Stipula programs can be modeled and formally verified in KeY. This is joint work with Cosimo Laneve (U Bologna) and Adele Veschetti.
