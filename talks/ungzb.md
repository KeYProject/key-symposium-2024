Online elections are especially vulnerable to external and internal threats compromising the privacy and integrity of the election. Thus, a voting system for online elections should enable the detection and correction of any errors in the election result â€” a property called strong software independence.
This can be achieved by risk-limiting audits, which however require adapting traditional privacy requirements for online elections so that sufficient evidence for the audits is produced.
In this talk, I present on-going work on the formalization and verification of secret and end-to-end-verifiable online elections that fulfill the traceability property necessary for post-election, risk-limiting audits, using the Tamarin prover.
