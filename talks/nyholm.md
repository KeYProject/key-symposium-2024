Electricity is a vital infrastructural need for all. Reducing energy consumption would benefit economics, sustainability, and the environment in today's climate. However, to reduce consumption, one must know what one consumes. Therefore, we have developed a novel energy profiling system for Java applications. The profiler's basis is on measurements of iterative execution of small segments of Java code. We will then employ both a Bayesian and a summative estimation model to compare the accuracy of their estimates. Note that this is an ongoing paper. Hence, no results are yet available.
