Formal verification of cyber-physical systems is one way to guarantee safety. However, care must be taken because modelling errors might result in proving a faulty controller safe, which is potentially catastrophic in practice. We deal with two such modelling errors in differential dynamic logic, and provide conditions under which these two modelling errors cannot cause a faulty controller to be proven safe. We also show how these conditions can be proven with help of KeYmaera X.
