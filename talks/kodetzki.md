In recent years, research in the field of artificial intelligence has made great progress. AI-tools are getting better in simulating human reasoning and behaviour every day. In this paper, we discuss the extent to which AI-tools can support Correctness-by-Construction engineering. This is an approach of formal methods to developing functionally correct programs incrementally on the basis of a formal specification. Using sound refinement rules, the correctness of the constructed program can already be guaranteed in the development process. We analyze the Correctness-by-Construction process regarding steps for potential AI-tool support in the tool CorC, which implements Correctness-by-Construction. We classify the findings in five areas of interest. Based on existing work, expert knowledge, and prototypical experiments, we discuss for each of the areas whether and to what extent AI-tools can support Correctness-by-Construction software development. We address the risk of AI-tools in formal methods and present our vision of AI-integration in the tool CorC to support developers in constructing programs using Correctness-by-Construction engineering.
