## Social Event

On Monday, July 29th, we have an optional social event before the official start. <a href="mailto:kirsten@kit.edu">Michael Kirsten</a> organizes a hiking trip in the black forest with medium difficulty of ca. 9km taking about 3 hours, that requires public local transport to get to the starting point. The hiking group will meet at **12:35 pm at the venue** to drop their luggage. Please mark your interest during the registration to stay informed.

There will be (depending on the weather) an unsolicitious light hike on the second evening (Tuesday) to the monastery ruins of Frauenalb. Roughly 6km one way, downhill, you can cheat by using the local tram.

## Travel

**Reaching Karlsruhe.**  You can reach Karlsruhe by train using Deutsche Bahn. The nearest airport is Frankfurt (FRA) (roughly an 1 hour away by train). An option might be Stuttgart (STR, two hours away) or Baden-Baden (FKB, 40 min.).

**Reaching Bad Herrenalb from Karlsruhe.** You reach Bad Herrenalb by local transport from Karlsruhe: You take line S1 direction "Bad Herrenalb" to the final destination. This local train starts in front of the train station, called "Karlsruhe Hbf Vorplatz".  The local transporter is <a href="https://kvv.de">KVV</a>. The train ride takes 40 min. and the interval is 10 min. to 20 min. depending on the daytime. 

**The last mile.** The venue is 600 m away from the train station in Bad Herrenalb. Please note, the way up to the venue is steep. You can access it also from the back side, which is better reachable from the train station, see
