[You can register for as many talks/discussions as you like via this form](https://forms.gle/toKvMNLUqazYS4oc6).

Until **July 7th**, you should at least announce your talks with a
minimal version ("Title: tbd" and some keywords in the abstract to
find a suitable session). But we would appreciate even an early
announcement. The schedule is tight, so please announce in time. Your
entry should be properly finalized until _July, 21st_ with a proper
title and abstract so that we can compile the final schedule.

Note the novelty: You can select **one of three tracks**. As the
KeYmaera group joined our symposium, we will split some sessions.
Your choices are the common track (KeY+KeYmaera) or KeY/KeYmaera-
specific track. The final decision is made by the program board
(Enguerrand Prebet and Alexander Weigl).
