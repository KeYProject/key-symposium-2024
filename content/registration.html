	This year, we are working with registration fees instead of
	posterior invoices. We are planning to other the following
	booking options:

	<ol>
	  <li>
	    <strong>Regular:</strong> (ca. 520 EUR) includes everything: The overnight stay
	    (single bedroom) at "Haus der Kirche", the conference costs
	    (breakfast, lunch, dinner), the social dinner.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <strong>Regular w/o overnight stay</strong> (ca. 320 EUR): All of regular but we do not book a
	    room for you. This might be a choice. If you want to come with
	    family and you stay at a different hotel. "Haus der Kirche" only
	    offers double bedrooms.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <strong>Dinner-only</strong> (59 EUR): To enable the
	    participation of our alumni at the social event, we will
	    offer theoption of joining us at the social event.

	  You can register for as many talks/discussions as you like using
	  the form below.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Until <span class="text-bold text-warning">July 7th</span>, you
	  should at least announce your talks with a minimal version:
	  ("Title: tbd" and some keywords in the abstract to find a
	  suitable session).
	</p>

	<p>
	  But we would appreciate even an early
	  announcement. The schedule is tight, so please announce in
	  time. Your entry should be properly finalized until <span class="bg-error text-bold">July,
	  21st</span> with a proper title and abstract so that we can compile
	  the final schedule.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Note the novelty: You can select <span class="bg-secondary">one of three tracks</span>. As
	  the KeYmaera group joined our symposium, we will split some
	  sessions.  Your choices are the common track (KeY+KeYmaera) or
	  KeY/KeYmaera- specific track. The final decision is made by
	  the program board (Enguerrand Prebet and Alexander Weigl).
